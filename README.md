# Snake Game Remake

## Game Description

This is a remake of the classic snake game. It was made for learning pygame (or to have fun.) It was created by [Fesuoy](https://github.com/fesuoy1), and it was made in 2024. It's still in its beta
stages, so it may contain bugs and may not work as intended.

## How To Play

1. Start the game
2. Use the arrow keys to move the snake
3. Eat the food
4. Avoid hitting the walls (or the snake itself)
5. Have fun!

## Game Controls
